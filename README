MailIt! version 1.0

MailIt! is a free module for the Roxen Web Server. It allows easy formatting
and mailing of HTML Form data without the need to program custom CGI
scripts.

Please remember that this is a work in progress. Your comments and
suggestions are appreciated. You can send your comments to me, the
developer at hww3@riverweb.com.

If you find this module useful, I'd greatly appreciate a postcard from you
letting me know you're out there. My Address is included in the
distribution.

[Requirements]

   * Roxen 1.2 or higher.
   * sendmail or compatible mailer (qmail is rumoured to work).

[Getting MailIt!]

   * Download the latest version of MailIt! with Documentation (v0.93) from
	http://www.riverweb.com/modules/mailit/dist/

[Installing MailIt!]

Using MailIt! is simple! Just download the archive, then unpack it by using
the following command:

        tar -zxvf mailit-1.0.tar.gz

You should get a directory called mailit-1.0. Inside that directory is a
file called mailit.pike. Copy that file to your Roxen modules directory,
under roxen/server/modules. Then you can use the Configuration Interface to
add the MailIt! module.

There are a few options you can change, but in most cases it won't be
nessecary. If your sendmail binary is in a location other than /usr/lib,
you'll need to make the appropriate adjustments.

Included is support for MailIt! to set the sender of messages based on the
owner of the template file. This is available only if Roxen is running as
a sendmail trusted user. Check your sendmail man page for more info.

You can also turn on debug messages, which can provide helpful information
for me if I'm looking for a bug.

That's all there is to it! You can now start using the features of the
MailIt! module.

[Using MailIt!]

There are 3 components of a working MailIt! application:

   * The MailIt! Module (you've already installed it)
   * An HTML Form Page
   * A MailIt! Template Page

[The HTML Form Page]
You can use any text or HTML editor you'd like to create the form page. This
just contains the fields that you'd like to have mailed when a user presses
the submit button. The key is to set the form action to be the URL of an
HTML page that uses the features of MailIt!. When designing your form,
simply keep in mind the names of the various elements that you add to the
form. You'll need to supply these in the Template page later.

[The MailIt! Template]
The MailIt! Template is simply an HTML file that includes MailIt! tags. The
four tags that are provided by MailIt! are:

     <mailit> </mailit> <mailheader>, <mailmessage></mailmessage> and
	<mfield>

The first tag tells MailIt! that you are going to send an email message. 
Anything enclosed by these tags will not get returned to the browser.
Everything outside the mailit tags will be returned to the browser as a
response to the form submission.

The second tag tells MailIt! to add a header to the outgoing message.

The mailheader tag takes the following attributes:

  subject=value		Adds a subject line. Use this by itself.

  to=value		Adds a to: line in the message header. Also use
			this by itself.
  
  name=headername	Adds a header called headername. Can be used to
			create carbon copies and blind carbon copies.

  value=headervalue	Use with name to specify the header value.

The third container tag is used to define the message body.

The mailmessage container takes the following argument:

  encoding=endodingtype	Send the message using MIME encoding. The
			following types are supported:

			8bit, 7bit, base64, binary, quoted-printable, and
			x-uue.
The default encoding is 7bit, if another encoding is not specified.

The fourth tag tells MailIt! to print the value of a form element that you
specify. You can include these tags inside the mailit container to send the
information from the form in the email message.

The mfield tag takes the following attribute:

name="Field Name"
     The name of the Form Field to insert. This is case sensitive. If you
     specify a bad form field or if the field is empty, mailit will return
     "Field Empty" as the response.

empty="text" 
        Gives an alternative response to the default for empty fields.
	Can be blank (i.e. empty="").

add="text"
        Text to add after a non-empty field to allow for certain formatting
	needs e.g "<p>" to add a newline after nonblank fields only (best used 
	with empty="").

You can put any RXML tags within the body of your message. The formatting
between the mailit tags is preserved when it is sent as a message.
